## Project Overview

Expo v1 is a personal implementation of a cross-platform development framework that enables creating mobile applications for both Android and iOS, as well as web applications, all from a single codebase. The project focuses on simplifying the mobile development process while maintaining native performance.

## Features Implemented

* **Universal Components** - Core UI components that render natively across platforms
* **Hot Reloading** - Instant updates during development without rebuilding
* **Native API Access** - Simple interfaces to access device features like camera and location
* **Simplified Builds** - One-command builds for multiple platforms
* **Development Tools** - Debug tools and performance monitoring

## Implementation Details

The framework was built with several key technologies and approaches:

1. **React Native** as the foundation for cross-platform component rendering
2. **JavaScript/TypeScript** for application logic and component definition
3. **Native Bridges** to interface with platform-specific APIs and features
4. **Project Templates** for quick start on new applications
5. **Configuration System** for customizing the build process

## Learning Outcomes

This personal project allowed me to:

* Gain deep understanding of mobile application architecture
* Learn the intricacies of cross-platform development
* Understand build processes for Android and iOS
* Develop strategies for maintaining consistent user experiences across platforms
