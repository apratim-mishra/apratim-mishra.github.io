## Project Overview

ScenicBayMapper is a personal project that helps users discover beautiful and interesting locations around the San Francisco Bay Area. The application combines mapping technology with crowd-sourced data and personalized recommendations to create an engaging platform for exploring scenic routes and destinations.

## Features Implemented

## Implementation Details

The application was built using several key technologies:

1. **React** for the frontend user interface with responsive design
2. **Google Maps API** for mapping, geocoding, and route optimization
3. **Node.js backend** with Express for API endpoints and data processing
4. **MongoDB** with geospatial indexing for location data storage
5. **Authentication system** for user accounts and personalization
