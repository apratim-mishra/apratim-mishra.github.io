## Project Overview

As a Research Intern at the Delaware Army National Guard, I developed a comprehensive energy load prediction system to analyze historical energy consumption patterns and forecast future demand. This project aimed to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and improve resource allocation for military facilities.

## Key Achievements

- Analyzed complex time-series data of energy consumption patterns
- Implemented multiple predictive models including ARIMA, XGBoost, LGBMBoost, and LSTMs
- Performed rigorous statistical testing to verify data integrity and model performance
- Achieved high accuracy in short-term and medium-term energy load forecasting
- Provided actionable insights for energy optimization strategies

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (for LSTM implementation)
- **Statistical Analysis**: statsmodels, scipy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Methodology

The project followed a structured approach to energy load prediction:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered historical energy consumption data from multiple facilities
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and normalized features
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created temporal features, lag variables, and external factors (weather, occupancy)
4. **Model Development**: Implemented and compared multiple forecasting models
   - ARIMA for baseline time-series forecasting
   - XGBoost and LGBMBoost for gradient boosting approaches
   - LSTMs for capturing long-term dependencies
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
6. **Validation**: Conducted one-sample and two-sample statistical tests to verify results

## Impact

The energy load prediction system provided several benefits:
- Enabled more accurate resource planning and allocation
- Identified patterns of energy waste and inefficiency
- Supported cost-saving initiatives through better demand forecasting
- Provided a foundation for future energy optimization projects

## Future Directions

Potential extensions of this project include:
- Integration with building management systems for automated response
- Incorporation of more external variables (e.g., detailed weather data)
- Development of a real-time monitoring and alerting system
- Expansion to include renewable energy sources and storage optimization
