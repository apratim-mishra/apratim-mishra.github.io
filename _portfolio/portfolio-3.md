## Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing energy load trends and developing accurate predictive models to forecast future energy consumption patterns. By leveraging historical data, weather patterns, and seasonal factors, we created a comprehensive system that enables better resource planning and optimization.

## Challenges Addressed

* Handling time series data with multiple seasonality patterns
* Incorporating external factors like weather and holidays
* Balancing short-term accuracy with long-term trend prediction
* Developing interpretable models for stakeholder decision-making

## Implementation Details

The prediction system employed a multi-model approach with ensemble techniques:

1. **Statistical models** (ARIMA, SARIMA) for baseline predictions and time series decomposition
2. **Gradient boosting models** (XGBoost, LightGBM) for capturing complex feature interactions
3. **Deep learning models** (LSTM networks) for capturing sequential patterns and long-term dependencies
4. **Ensemble methods** to combine predictions and optimize for different time horizons
5. **Feature engineering pipeline** to extract temporal features and incorporate external data sources

## Results & Impact

The system delivered significant improvements over previous forecasting methods:

* **92% accuracy** for 24-hour ahead predictions
* **85% accuracy** for weekly forecasts
* Reduced energy procurement costs by approximately 12%
* Provided actionable insights for load balancing and demand response programs

The solution has been implemented at multiple utility companies and has contributed to more efficient energy resource allocation.
