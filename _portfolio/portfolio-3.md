## Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing energy load trends and developing accurate predictive models to forecast future energy consumption patterns. Using data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption), we created a comprehensive system that enables better resource planning and optimization.

## Key Features

* Multiple forecasting models (ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM)
* Time series analysis with seasonal decomposition
* Feature engineering for temporal data
* Ensemble methods for improved accuracy
* Interactive visualizations for trend analysis

## Implementation Details

The prediction system uses a multi-model approach:

1. **Time Series Models**
   * ARIMA for baseline predictions
   * Seasonal decomposition for pattern analysis
   * Sequential pattern detection

2. **Machine Learning Models**
   * XGBoost and LightGBM for feature interaction
   * LSTM networks for sequential patterns
   * Ensemble methods for combined predictions

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   * Temporal feature extraction
   * Weather data integration
   * Anomaly detection
   * Missing value handling

## Results & Impact

* **Accuracy Metrics:**
  * 92% accuracy for 24-hour predictions
  * 85% accuracy for weekly forecasts
  * 12% reduction in energy costs

* **Key Achievements:**
  * Implemented at multiple utility companies
  * Improved resource allocation efficiency
  * Enhanced demand response programs

## Technologies Used
