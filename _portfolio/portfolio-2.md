## Project Overview

As a Graduate NLP Programmer at The Cline Centre for Advanced Social Research, I developed a sophisticated natural language processing pipeline designed to extract quotations from text and classify entities. This project aimed to automate the analysis of large text corpora, particularly news articles and social media content, to identify who said what and in what context.

## Key Achievements

- Engineered an end-to-end NLP pipeline for quotation extraction using spaCy and Stanford CoreNLP
- Implemented robust testing strategies and evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy
- Fine-tuned transformer models like BERT and XLNet for precise quote classification
- Enhanced evaluation accuracy by focusing on 'span' matching techniques
- Created comprehensive documentation for the pipeline's architecture and usage

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP, NLTK
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Models**: BERT, XLNet
- **Testing**: pytest, scikit-learn metrics

## Impact

The quotation extraction pipeline significantly reduced the manual effort required to analyze text corpora, enabling researchers to process larger volumes of data more efficiently. The improved accuracy in entity classification also enhanced the quality of subsequent analyses, leading to more reliable research outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized text data
2. **Quote Detection**: Identified potential quotations using rule-based and ML approaches
3. **Entity Recognition**: Detected and classified entities (speakers, organizations)
4. **Quote Attribution**: Linked quotes to their respective speakers
5. **Validation**: Applied rigorous testing to ensure accuracy

## Future Directions

Future enhancements to this project could include:
- Extending the pipeline to handle multiple languages
- Incorporating sentiment analysis of quotations
- Developing a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Implementing real-time processing capabilities for streaming data
