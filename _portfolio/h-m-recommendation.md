## Project Overview

This project develops a fashion recommendation system for H&M products using a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based methods. The system uses historical purchase data, product descriptions, and customer attributes to generate personalized fashion recommendations.

## Features Implemented

* **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** - Combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
* **Product Embeddings** - Generated from product descriptions and attributes
* **User Preference Modeling** - Learns customer preferences from historical purchases
* **Seasonal Trend Analysis** - Incorporates temporal patterns in fashion preferences
* **Evaluation Framework** - Comprehensive metrics for recommendation quality assessment

## Implementation Details

The recommendation system includes several key components:

1. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning and transformation of H&M product and transaction data
2. **Feature Engineering** - Extraction of relevant features from text descriptions and metadata
3. **Collaborative Filtering Model** - Matrix factorization approach for user-item interactions
4. **Content-Based Model** - Leverages product attributes and descriptions
5. **Hybrid Model** - Combines multiple recommendation approaches for optimal results
6. **Evaluation Pipeline** - Metrics include precision, recall, and ranking-based measures

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:

* Develop expertise in building hybrid recommendation systems
* Implement techniques for handling sparse user-item interaction data
* Apply NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from product descriptions
* Design effective evaluation strategies for recommendation systems
