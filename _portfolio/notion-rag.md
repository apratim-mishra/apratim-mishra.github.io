## Project Overview

Notion RAG is a system that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide AI-powered answers from Notion databases. The project integrates Notion's API, vector search capabilities, and language models to create an intelligent knowledge retrieval system.

## Features Implemented

* **Notion Integration** - Seamless indexing of Notion databases and content
* **Vector Search** - Efficient retrieval using Qdrant for vector similarity search
* **RAG Pipeline** - Combines retrieved documents with AI generation for accurate answers
* **API Endpoints** - Flask-based REST API for search and question answering
* **Command-Line Interface** - Simple CLI for direct interaction

## Implementation Details

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Notion Indexer** - Extracts and processes content from Notion databases
2. **Embedding Generator** - Creates vector representations of text content
3. **Vector Database** - Stores and indexes embeddings for efficient retrieval
4. **RAG Engine** - Combines retrieval results with language model generation
5. **API Server** - Provides endpoints for search and question answering
6. **CLI Tool** - Enables command-line access to the system's capabilities

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:

* Gain hands-on experience with modern RAG architectures
* Develop skills in vector embeddings and similarity search
* Implement efficient data processing pipelines for unstructured text
* Create a production-ready API for NLP applications
