## Project Overview

This research project focused on developing and optimizing protein language models (PLMs) to derive insights and predict complex biological behaviors. By combining state-of-the-art language modeling techniques with graph neural networks, we were able to capture both sequential and structural information from protein data.

## Challenges Addressed

* Processing and analyzing large-scale protein sequence datasets
* Developing efficient training pipelines for transformer-based models
* Integrating graph-based representations with language model embeddings
* Optimizing computational resources for large-scale biological data

## Implementation Details

The project utilized PyTorch for model development and PyTorch Geometric for graph-based representations. We implemented several key innovations:

1. **Multi-scale feature extraction** from protein sequences using transformer architectures
2. **Graph neural network layers** to capture structural relationships between amino acids
3. **Knowledge distillation techniques** to create more efficient models for deployment
4. **Distributed training pipelines** with DeepSpeed to scale model training

## Results & Impact

Our models achieved significant improvements over previous approaches:

* **15% improvement** in protein function prediction accuracy
* **30% reduction** in computational resources required for inference
* Successfully predicted protein-protein interactions with **87% accuracy**
* Identified novel potential binding sites for drug development

The research has potential applications in drug discovery, protein engineering, and understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level.

## Technologies Used

* **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, Hugging Face Transformers
* **Training Optimization**: DeepSpeed, Ray, Distributed Training
* **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, BioPython
* **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS EC2, S3, Batch

## Future Directions

Future work on this project could include:
- Integration with other biological data sources
- Extension to model protein-ligand interactions
- Development of more interpretable models for biological insights
- Application to specific disease targets

## Publications and Presentations

This work was presented at internal research conference at AstraZeneca and contributed to ongoing research in the field of computational biology and drug discovery.
