## Project Overview

During my internship at AstraZeneca, I worked on developing and optimizing protein language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze protein structures and predict biological behaviors. This project aimed to improve drug discovery processes by providing better insights into protein-drug interactions.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented state-of-the-art protein language models to analyze protein sequences and structures
- Developed graph neural networks to model protein-protein interactions
- Optimized model architecture to decrease computational and memory footprint
- Implemented multi-GPU scalability for faster inference times
- Achieved significant improvements in modeling characteristics compared to baseline models

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Optimization Tools**: DeepSpeed, Accelerate
- **Libraries**: BioPython, PyG (PyTorch Geometric)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, PyMOL

## Impact

The models developed in this project significantly improved the ability to predict protein-drug interactions, potentially accelerating the drug discovery process. The optimized architecture also reduced computational costs, making it more feasible to run complex simulations at scale.

## Future Directions

Future work on this project could include:
- Integration with other biological data sources
- Extension to model protein-ligand interactions
- Development of more interpretable models for biological insights
- Application to specific disease targets

## Publications and Presentations

This work was presented at internal research symposiums at AstraZeneca and contributed to ongoing research in the field of computational biology and drug discovery.
